But there's one important rule: You need to check the third digit to decide whether to round up or down.\n\nSteps to Round to 2 Decimal Places:\nLook at the third digit (the number three places after the decimal).\nIf the third digit is 5 or higher, round the second digit up by 1.\nIf the third digit is less than 5, leave the second digit as it"
